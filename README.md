# Hey there

I'm Akop.

I'm an Android engineer by profession, but I do a bit of
everything, including [server-side code](https://github.com/0xe1f/grouch), [graphics](https://github.com/0xe1f/FBNeo)
and [low-level OS stuff](https://github.com/8bitpsp/psplib) - mostly whatever happens to be interesting at the moment.

Most often, I write code.  
Sometimes, I do basic [electronics projects](https://github.com/0xe1f/NeoGeoWireless).  
Sometimes, I do [3D printing](https://github.com/0xe1f/NeoGeoWireless/blob/8a376b78544e930451821690862c74f65e591a03/stl/NGRcvrSNES.stl).  
And sometimes they all [combine together in fascinating ways](https://github.com/0xe1f/red).

I've spent most of my effort toward porting [various](https://github.com/0xe1f/FinalBurn-X) [emulators](https://github.com/CocoaMSX/CocoaMSX)
to various systems, including a [wide variety](https://github.com/8bitpsp) of those of classic systems to Sony PSP, but I've also had a couple
of popular Android apps over the years, including Spark 360 and alphacross.
