# Hey there

I'm Akop.

I'm an Android engineer by profession, but I do a bit of
everything, including [server-side code](https://github.com/0xe1f/grouch), [graphics](https://github.com/0xe1f/FBNeo)
and [low-level OS stuff](https://github.com/8bitpsp/psplib) - mostly whatever happens to be interesting at the moment.

Most often, I write code.  
Sometimes, I do basic [electronics projects](https://github.com/0xe1f/NeoGeoWireless).  
Sometimes, I do [3D printing](https://github.com/0xe1f/3dprint/blob/master/nes/nes_cart_bottom.stl).  
And every so often, they all [combine together in fascinating ways](https://github.com/0xe1f/red).
